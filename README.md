# [*fdtd-z*](github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz) -- fast, scalable, and free photonic simulation
***fdtd-z*** is our first step in *revolutionizing photonic design* by enabling photonic engineers to **harness compute at scale**.

* **fast**: 100x faster than CPU implementations such as Meep, Lumerical, RSoft, ..., 
* **scalable**: easily runs simulations on hundreds of nodes and beyond,
* **free**: open-source, no license-fees!

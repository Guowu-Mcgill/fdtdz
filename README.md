# [*fdtd-z*](github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz) -- fast, scalable, accessible photonic simulation

* **fast**: 100x faster than CPU implementations such as Meep, Lumerical, RSoft, ..., 
* **scalable**: easily runs simulations on hundreds of nodes and beyond,
* **accessible**: open-source, no license-fees!

**[*fdtd-z*](github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz)** is our first step toward *revolutionizing photonic design* by
enabling photonic engineers to **harness compute at scale**. [Try it now!](github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz) (link coming)

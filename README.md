# [*fdtd-z*](github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz) -- fast, scalable, accessible photonic simulation

*fdtd-z* is an implementation of the [finite-difference time-domain method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method) that is

* **fast**: 100x faster than CPU implementations such as Meep, Lumerical, RSoft, ..., 
* **scalable**: easily runs simulations on hundreds of nodes and beyond,
* **accessible**: open-source, license-free, and universally accessible.

  """Execute a FDTD simulation.

  `fdtd-z` is an implementation of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
  method that is efficiently mapped to the GPU via a systolic update scheme
  [1]. This function exposes, as a JAX primitive, a relatively low-level API
  to the underlying CUDA kernel.

  `fdtd-z` targets nanophotonic applications with a heavy prioritization on
  simulation throughput, as insufficient throughput is currently the
  bottleneck in many workflows (such as nanophotonic inverse design). As such,
  the flexibility and features of the engine have been kept to a bare
  minimum in the name of performance:

    - Reduced-precision mode is available and recommended which utilizes
      16-bit floating point internally (input and output arrays are always
      at single-precision) and allows for ~2 times larger z-extent. Requires
      (Nvidia) GPUs of compute capability >= 6.0.

    - Z-extent (`zz`) of the simulation domain is fixed to a specific value to
      allow for a natural mapping to the 32 threads/warp architecture of
      Nvidia GPUs. The required value of `zz` is given by either `128 - p` or
      `64 - p` for the cases of reduced precision or full precision
      respectively, where `p` is the total number of PML layers for the
      simulation.

    - PML boundary conditions [2] are limited to the z-direction, adiabatic
      aborbing boundaries [3] must be used in the x- and y-directions.

    - Absorption (apart from absorbing boundary conditions) and dispersion are
      not implemented. The simulated structure must consist of a real-valued
      permittivity that depends only on the E-field component and spatial
      location.

    - The permeability is fixed at a value of `1` everywhere in the simulation
      domain.

    - Only current sources as hyperplanes along the y- and z-axes are
      implemented.
  
  `fdtd-z` uses a "dimensionless" system [4] where the permittivity and
  permeability of vacuum (and therefore the speed of light), as well as the size
  of the Yee cell are all set to a (dimensionless) value of `1` (although the
  size of the cell along the z-axis can be varied).

  Args:

    epsilon: `(3, xx, yy, zz)`-shaped array of floats representing the
      permittivity values at the `Ex`, `Ey`, and `Ez` nodes of the Yee cell
      respectively. We use the convention that these components are located at
      `(0.5, 0, 0)`, `(0, 0.5, 0)`, and `(0, 0, 0.5)` respectively, for a Yee
      cell of side-length 1.

    dt: Scalar float representing the amount of time elapsed in one update step.

    source_field: Either a `(2, 2, xx, yy)`-shaped array for a source at
      `z = source_position` or a `(2, xx, zz)`-shaped array for a source at
      `y = source_position`. For a source at `z = source_position`, each
      `(i, 2, xx, yy)` subarray represents one of two source fields each of
      which holds `Ex` and `Ey` fields (in that order), while for a source at
      `y = source_position`, the source field holds `Ex` and `Ez` (in that
      order).

    source_waveform: `(tt, 2)`-shaped array of floats denoting the temporal
      variation to apply to the each of the source fields, where `tt` is the
      total number of update steps needed (note that the first update occurs at
      step `0`). Specifically, the subarray at `(tt, i)` applies a temporal
      variation to the `(i, 2, xx, yy)` subarray of a source at
      `z = source_position`, while for a source at `y = source_position` the
      temporal variation is applied to the source field at
      `y = source_position - i`.

    source_position: integer representing the position of the source along
      either the y- or z-axes. For the case of a source at `y = source_position`
      the source field is applied (with the corresponding waveform) at both
      `y = source_position` and `y = source_position - 1`, with the additional
      performance constraint that `source_position` must be even.

    absorption_mask: `(3, xx, yy)`-shaped array of floats representing a
      z-invariant conductivity intended to allow for adiabatic absorbing 
      boundary conditions along the x- and y-axes according to
      `conductivity(x, y, z) = aborption_mask(x, y) * epsilon(x, y, z)`
      for the `Ex`, `Ey`, and `Ez` component respectively.

    pml_kappa: `(zz, 2)`-shaped array of floats denoting the distance along the
      z-axis between adjacent Yee cells. This is primarily intended to be used
      as a stretching parameter for the PML, but equivalently also determines 
      the unit cell length along the z-axis throughout the simulation domain.
      Specifically, `(zz, 0)` represents the distance between successive layers
      of `Ex`, `Ey`, and `Hz` nodes, while `(zz, 1)` represents the distance
      between layers of `Hx`, `Hy`, and `Ez` nodes.

    pml_sigma: `(zz, 2)`-shaped array of floats for the conductivity of the PML
      region, where `(zz, 0)` and `(zz, 1)` are the values at the
      (`Ex`, `Ey`, `Hz`) and (`Hx`, `Hy`, `Ez`) layers respectively. Must be set
      to `0` outside of the PML regions.

    pml_widths: `(bot, top)` integers specifying the number of cells which
      are to be designated as PML layers at the bottom and top of the
      simulation respectively. For performance reasons, the total number of PML
      layers used in the simulation (`bot + top`) is required to be a multiple
      of `4`.

    output_steps: `(start, stop, interval)` tuple of integers denoting the
      update step at which to start recording output fields, the number of
      update steps separating successive output fields, and the step at which
      to stop recording (not included).

    use_reduced_precision: If `True`, uses 16-bit (IEEE 754) precision for the
      simulation which allows for a maximum of 128 cells along the z-axis.
      Otherwise, uses 32-bit single-precision with a maximum of 64 cells
      along the z-axis. Both inputs and results are always expected as 32-bit
      arrays.

    launch_params: Integers as an object in the form of 
      `((blocku, blockv), (gridu, gridv), spacing, (cc_major, cc_minor))`,
      specifying the structure of the systolic update to use on the GPU.
        - `(blocku, blockv)` determines the layout of warps in the u- and
          v-directions within a block and should be `(2, 4)` or `(4, 2)`.
        - `(gridu, gridv)` specify the layout of blocks on the GPU and must be
          equal to or less than the number of streaming multiprocessors on the
          GPU because of the need for grid-wide synchronization.
        - `spacing` controls the number of buffers used between each block and
          its downstream neighbor and should be tuned to balance between
          reducing grid synchronization overhead and staying within the limits
          of the L2 cache.
        - `(cc_major, cc_minor)` major and minor compute capability of the
          device. Used to determine which precompiled kernel to use. Currently
          allowed values are `(3, 7)`, `(6, 0)`, `(7, 0)`, `(7, 5)`, and
          `(8, 0)`. Recommended to use the latest compute capability kernel
          possible that does not exceed the compute capability of the device.

  Returns:
    `(n, 3, xx, yy, zz)` array of floats representing `n` output fields, where
    each output field consists of the values of the `Ex`, `Ey`, and `Ez` node
    (in that order) over the simulation domain, at a specific update step.
